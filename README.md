# Time Series Chart Using Highchart with CSV File

This is a simple example to show how to use the highcharts code with a csv file. The data is represented in a Time Series Chart.

This code is based on the highcharts general documentation available at: highcharts.com

The data used was extracted from the National Centers for Environmental Information website (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). 

An asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request is used to read the contents of the CSV file.

Then, the time series chart is loaded and displayed in the div tag container.

The following files should be stored in the same folder:

* index.html
* timeseries.js
* timeseries.csv
